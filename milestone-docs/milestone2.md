# Milestone 2 - 6.470 #

**1. Did any of your answers to Milestone 1 change?** 

Our website focus has changed a little bit since the last milestone (User Research #1-4), as we are now focusing in on creating personalized recommendations for users who have certain dietary restrictions. As such, our application will suggest recipes and possible ingredient substitutions that will help users with special dietary destrictions more easily meet their goals. The other questions remain the same.
<br/><br/>
**2. Which features are implemented. To what extent are they complete?**

We implemented a way to view recipes, add recipes, and view a user's diet. We set up a test account for the 6.470 staff:
username: guestuser
password: guest

A visitor of the site can click on the top right to actually open the login menu. These features have all core functionality implemented, although there are many parts that are not yet polished.
<br/><br/>

**3. Are there any features you wanted to include in your MVP from Milestone 1 that are not complete? If so, which are they?**

Since we narrowed our focus for the milestone relatively recently as a response to the project pitch that we did, we were not able to implement a good algorithm behind picking which recipes are suitable for people with certain dietary restrictions. We also were not able to implement as much of the front-end design as we had liked, as we are not relying on any previously-created UI templates.
<br/><br/>
**4. What additional features do you wish to implement? How far along on those features are you?**

We want to have a good algorithm for accurately picking diets. We also need to improve the user interface on many pages, replace filler images in various locations on the site, and add smaller features that will help the user have a more comfortable experience when selecting their recipes and viewing them. These features are mainly for connecting our site together and making a pleasant experience for the user. We already have the core features for our site, so each of these features should not take too long to implement.
<br/><br/>
**5. What technologies are you using for the back-end? Include any frameworks if relevant.**

We used Django to implement the backend. We also used some libraries for Django (Dajax and Dajaxice) to help us implement AJAX features.
<br/><br/>
**6. What technologies are you using for the front-end?**

For the front-end, we used jQuery. Everything else is implemented from pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript that we wrote by ourselves.
<br/><br/>
**7. What is the main browser you are targeting?**

We are targeting Google Chrome.
<br/><br/>
**8. What implementation unknown / risks are you still facing?**

It could be difficult to think of a good algorithm for selecting meals for people with dietary restrictions.

**Note:**

Due to some frustrations with Django and the scripts server, some parts of the website may be quite broken.
